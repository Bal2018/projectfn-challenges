PirateScript Encryption:

You are a pirate trying to contact your captain, however you are scared of other competitive pirates in the market. You need to send a message saying the following:

“I am stranded with a sum of 4000 pounds worth of gold. Send help”

You need to write a function that can encode this message to say:

“Iarr maarr trandedsarr ithwarr aarr umsaar foarr 4000 doubloons orthwarr foarr oldgarr. endsarr elpharr.”
