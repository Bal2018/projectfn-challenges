Scope Troubles:

You are given a function called getName. The function should work as follows:
-	It should ask the user to enter a name
-	It should return the entered name
-	If the entered name is empty, it should return ‘unknown’

This function is currently broken as it won’t return ‘unknown’ when entering nothing. 
Figure out what is happening?

Correct the program so it prints "unknown" if the name is not enetered.
